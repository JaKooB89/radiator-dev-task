# Creative Dev Task 2020
###### Author - Jakub Czaja (jakoob89@gmail.com)

## 3rd Party Libraries:
##### Line Awesome (https://icons8.com/line-awesome): Icon Library
##### Slick (https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/): Responsive slider
##### jQuery (https://jquery.com/): Dependency for slick

## Tools:
##### Sass - css preprocessor
##### Gulp - task runner (compiles and minifies assets)
##### Autoprefixer - automatic vendor prefixes

## Tests:
##### Because of a limited time, the page, is tested only on the newest versions of the most popular browsers (Chrome/FF/Opera/Edge) and the devices at hand (PC / Pixel 4).
##### Because I decided to experiment with CSS Grid - the page in not compatible with Internet Explorer. In production, I'd consider using fallback.
